# My Digital RTL Journey: From Verilog to Silicon with Sky130 üöÄ

Welcome! This repository documents my hands-on learning journey through the world of **Verilog RTL design and digital synthesis**. It's a personal log of my progress and practical projects, covering everything from writing code to preparing a design for fabrication using the open-source SKY130 technology.
